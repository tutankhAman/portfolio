Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Aman Aziz, I'm a caffeine-fueled programmer and a student at VIT Bhopal, on a mission to turn code into magic and designs into experiences that make users go, "Wow, they *get* me!"

I started coding a year ago, and now I'm hookedâ€”like a JavaScript function stuck in an infinite loop. When I'm not wrestling with bugs or designing user-friendly interfaces, you'll find me leveling up in games, getting lost in anime, or sketching questionable masterpieces. Sleep? Overratedâ€”coffee's got my back.

I believe great design starts with seeing the world through the user's eyes (and sometimes their Wi-Fi struggles). Let's create something epicâ€”and maybe grab a coffee while we're at it! â˜•ðŸš€
